      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p id="first-paragraph">Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Angela, and I am in the process of returning to full-time professional employment after a hiatus to focus on my family. I’m glad you’re here to learn a little bit more about me and the path I’ve taken thus far in my career and life. </p>

       <p id="second-paragraph'">After graduating valedictorian of my high school class, I went to 
         <a href="https://www.indiana.edu">Indiana University</a> 
         with the original intent of studying Secondary Education with a Math specialty and a minor in computer science. I had a delightful computer science professor my first semester of my freshman year named George Springer, and that man saw that I, out of a class of 100+ students, had an apitutde for programming. He told me I should change my major. It just so happened that in that same week, I read an article in the Indiana Daily Student about starting salaries for Computer Science majors, and my mind was made up! I graduated in the top 3 in the computer science departmnent, and immediately took a systems analyst job with Eli Lilly and Company.  </p>
